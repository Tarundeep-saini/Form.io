# Form.io
Made using MERN , Tailwind CSS

From.io allows users to create forms that encompass three different types of questionsâ€”categories, comprehension, and Cloze. Other users can then fill out these forms and review the results. The backend system conducts checks on the forms to uphold security measures throughout the process.
